# ESP32_oled_ir
This repo is about getting started with ESP32.In this repo you will cover two topic sending and receiving data from ESP32.This repo is about receiving data from an IR sensor and  display robotics eyes on an OLED 128x64 display using ESP32.

**ACT 1 COMPONENT SELECTION**

ESP32:There are many benefits for using ESP32 than Arduino Nano.It is much faster, has more memory, and has built-in Wifi and bluetooth.

OLED:For this project 128X64 OLED is selected.It has much more pixel than a normal 16x2 display, so it gives more room being creative with the diplay.

IR SENSOR:The functionality of this IR sensor is that it help us to understand how data is sent to ESP32.If we take it further we can get creative with it.If the IR sensor receives zero it will look up otherwise it will continue to blink.
